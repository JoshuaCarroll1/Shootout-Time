## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

| Page | W3C URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2FJoshuaCarroll1.github.io%2FShootout-Time%2Findex.html) | ![screenshot](documentation/html-validation-home.png) | Section lacks header h2-h6 warning |

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.


| File | Jigsaw URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| style.css | [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2FJoshuaCarroll1.github.io%2FShootout-Time) | ![screenshot](documentation/css-validation-style.png) | Pass: No Errors |

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.

| File | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| script.js | ![screenshot](documentation/js-validation-script.png) | Unused variables from external files |

## User Story Testing


| User Story | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| As a new site user, I would like to take penalties, so that I can score goals. | ![screenshot](documentation/feature01.png) |
| As a new site user, I would like to choose any direction, so that I can score different goals. | ![screenshot](documentation/feature02.png) |
| As a new site user, I would like to score as many goals as possible, so that I can get a high score. | ![screenshot](documentation/feature03.png) |
| As a returning site user, I would like to score more goals then before, so that I can see I am getting better. | ![screenshot](documentation/feature04.png) |

## Bugs


- JS Uncaught ReferenceError: `foobar` is undefined/not defined

### GitHub **Issues**

An improved way to manage bugs is to use the built-in **Issues** tracker on your GitHub repository.
To access your Issues, click on the "Issues" tab at the top of your repository.
Alternatively, use this link: https://github.com/JoshuaCarroll1/Shootout-Time/issues

If using the Issues tracker for your bug management, you can simplify the documentation process.
Issues allow you to directly paste screenshots into the issue without having to first save the screenshot locally,
then uploading into your project.

You can add labels to your issues (`bug`), assign yourself as the owner, and add comments/updates as you progress with fixing the issue(s).

Once you've sorted the issue, you should then "Close" it.

When showcasing your bug tracking for assessment, you can use the following format:

**Fixed Bugs**

All previously closed/fixed bugs can be tracked [here](https://github.com/JoshuaCarroll1/Shootout-Time/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).

| Bug | Status |

## Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding
implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

Some examples:

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug02.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.


There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
